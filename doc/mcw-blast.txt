				 MCW / BLAST

WHAT IS MCW / BLAST?

  BLAST is a tool developed by the National Center for Biotecnology
  Information.  While a useful tool, it doesn't scale across a cluster or
  super-computer on its own.  Hence the creation of MCW.  MCW is essentially
  a scheduler designed to distribute queries across multiple instances of
  BLAST.  MCW uses MPI to communicate across between nodes.

WHAT IS INCLUDED?

  This package contains a beta distribution of MCW, BLAST, and a library,
  stdiowrap.

WHAT IS REQUIRED?

  All dependencies for the ncbi toolkit must be met.  In addition, one needs
  MPI and the MPI development tools (mpicc and mpic++ compiler wrappers).  The
  makefiles included in this distribution assumes an installed copy of
  GNU Make and the GNU compiler collection.

HOW TO USE IT?

  Read the `INSTALL' file shipped with this distribution for building
  instructions.  Once you have properly compiled mcw and blastall, you may
  reference the examples in the examples/ directory for possible mcw
  configurations, and examples of possible job scripts to run on your system.
