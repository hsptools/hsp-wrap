Master sends DB files to all ranks
Each rank stores DB files into SHMs

Master sends initial WUs to all ranks
Each rank's scheduler:
  distributes WUs to SHMs
  requests spawns from the Runner

Runner informs scheduler when process is complete/failed
The scheduler:
  stores result into buffer
  pop WU from queue
    if njobs < ncores then request WUs from master
  stores WU into SHM
  requests spawn/continuation

Writer waits until buffer is not full
  If past size/time threshold then flush
  signals that buffer is empty/not-full

----

Runner:
  Requests:
    spawn_process()    // public
    service_process()  // a process is in need of help (needed if we wait()?
